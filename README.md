Testing Bayesian optimal experimental design, optimisation, and active learning with different acquisition functions

## Bayesian optimal experimental design

Maximise information gain for parameters/model using Expected Information Gain

Maximise information gain about system under study. Estimate parameters.

Prioritise samples that lead to greatest reduction in Shannon entropy 

## Active learning

Reduce predictive variance. Prioritise observations with greatest predictive variance (widest prediction intervals)

Prioritise samples/observations. Often for ML uses.

## Bayesian optimisation

Use ExpectedImprovement and UpperConfidenceBound

Optimise parameters with respect to cost function
